1. Socket
2. Threading
    - A thread is a subprocess that runs a set of commands individually of any other thread 
    - APPLICATION INTO CHAT ROOM APPLICATION
        So, every time a user connects to the server, a separate thread is created 
        for that user and communication from server to client takes place along 
        individual threads based on socket objects created for the identity of each client.
