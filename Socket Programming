# SOCKET PROGRAMMING IN PYTHON 

Goals needed:
    What is socket programming

    They require three concepts : 
        * Socket server

        * Socket Client

        * Sockets and the socket API: 
            * They are used to send messages accross a network.

            * They provide a form of inter-process communication (IPC) which are mechanisms an 
              operating system provides to allow the processes to manage shared data.
            
            * This network can be 
                - logical
                - local network to the computer
                - Physically connected to an external network
                * eg: internet which you connect to via your ISP
